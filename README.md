# Botlab-SLAM-and-exploration
This project is the second half of the Robotics Systems Lab. A brief description of the tasks in this Lab is given below.

1) The Botlab_ws directory contains all the required code to run various sections of this lab including complete SLAM, explorationn, PID tuning for the motors and the Fork-lift mechanism.

2) The design directory holds all the step files required for recreating the fork-lift deisgn. some parts were laser cut while some were 3D printed.

3) The final directory contains the IEEE formatted report for the lab.

4) A youtube link for some of the tasks is given below -
