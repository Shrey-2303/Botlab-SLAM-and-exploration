# Botlab-SLAM-and-exploration
This project is the second half of the Robotics Systems Lab. A brief description of the tasks in this Lab is given below.

a) Assemble the robot and manually drive it.
b) Write a PID contorl model for the motor velocities from Gyroscope and encoder values.
c) Implement complete SLAM on the bot.
d) Write a code for exploration of any maze laid out.
e) Design a lifting mechanism to complete tasks in the explored maize.


The descriptions of the directories are also given below - 

1) The Botlab_ws directory contains all the required code to run various sections of this lab including complete SLAM, explorationn, PID tuning for the motors and the Fork-lift mechanism.
2) The design directory holds all the step files required for recreating the fork-lift deisgn. some parts were laser cut while some were 3D printed.
3) The final directory contains the IEEE formatted report for the lab.
4) A youtube link for some of the tasks is given below -
